## Overview

Process Optimization with Workmate empowers organizations to streamline operations, enhance productivity, and potentially reduce operational costs by intelligently automating complex tasks. Using process mining, Workmate proposes improvements and executes actions whilst maintaining human-in-the-loop on complex tasks.

Businesses often struggle with improving processes due to data volume and update frequency making manual scenario testing strenuous and unreliable. Improvement of these processes typically involves complicated business logic that is difficult to encode into software.

Given the large downstream impact of possible process changes, there needs to be accessible and configurable guardrails, granular and traceable audits, and justifications on decisions made.

This application includes components to address common pain points and streamline process optimization efforts â€” impacting KPIs such as cost, standard time and success rate.
