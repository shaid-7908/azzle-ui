# Workmate for USG: Inventory Management, Visibility and Simulation.

Workmate enables supply chain teams to effectively manage inventory by calculating key inventory KPI figures, assessing the health of those KPIs, and empowering operators to run key simulations to drive towards inventory objectives.

## Overview
Workmate helps supply chain teams effectively manage inventory by calculating key inventory KPI figures, assessing the health of those KPIs, and empowering operators to run key simulations to drive towards inventory objectives.

## Key Features:

- **Inventory Workbench:** Workmate can be configured for both operational and financially-minded team members to help them understand the current inventory position and its health at the network level, item level, and every level in between. Workmate helps supply chain teams unify the operational imperatives of managing inventory effectively with the financial reality that inventory carrying costs must be managed responsibly - with the global organization outcomes top of mind.
- **Inventory Simulation:** Workmate enables operators to simulate complex inventory decisions across the network. The engine powering these simulations enables operators to define global and local constraints, helping to drive realistic and practically useful results. These results consider both the financial and operational constraints of the network - and empower the operator to make a fully-informed decision in near real-time to drive critical inventory processes.
- **Automated Inventory Alert Resolution:** This feature combines both automated alerting on key inventory metrics and events with organization-specific configurations. This helps users identify opportunities to ensure production continuity or item delivery - or alternatively, opportunities to reduce stock and drive working capital efficiency. Workmate enables the operator to traverse the value chain ontology and identify the best course of action to resolve issues, understanding the knock-on effects and dependencies of even simple activities, such as shifting production or procurement from one location to another.
