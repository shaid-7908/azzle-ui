# Workmate for Material Shortage Management
Workmate empowers teams to effectively manage material shortages by providing a global view into the impact of a shortage.
## Overview
Workmate helps teams effectively manage material shortages across the network by providing a global view into the impact of a shortage, with mitigation options to remediate issues. Workmate provides a robust framework to help teams simulate multiple resolutions so that an operator can identify alternatives. Each of the operator's decisions made with Workmate are captured in the Ontology to ensure subsequent decisions are guided by known best practices.

## Key Features:

- **Workmate Alert Cockpit:** Workmate allows users to proactively identify upcoming out-of-stock risks across all material types - raw, intermediate, finished, packaging, and more. The Workmate Alert Cockpit also enables users to configure business strategies to prioritize high-risk and impactful shortages across the portfolio for immediate intervention.

- **Material Shortage Simulation:** Operators can use Workmate to determine a course of action to mitigate or eliminate the material shortage. Operators can validate this course of action or simulate their own ideas to ensure a business-optimal and timely resolution.

- **User Collaboration Framework:** Workmate enables operators across teams and hierarchical lines to seamlessly collaborate on potential issues using natural language and securely store the result of each collaboration to help drive more efficient solutions every day.
