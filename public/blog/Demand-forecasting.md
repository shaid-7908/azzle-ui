# Workmate for Demand Forecasting
![image main](../blog-image/blog-10/blog-10-hero-1.png)
The Demand Forecasting Dashboard is designed to help customers predict demand for their products and proactively plan for increases or decreases in demand. This is based on an advanced statistical model that runs on historical sales data. It also allows the user to input some known future variables such as future price or anticipated sell amount for a certain time period. It also allows the user to save more forecasts and have them all available in the app to compare and contrast.

## Overview 

Workmate enables teams to generate demand forecasts across the entire SKU base. The forecasting module enables multiple models to be run in parallel and compared to determine the best strategy for each SKU, leveraging both internal data, such as historical sales and inventory, and external data, such as weather patterns.

Beyond just a forward-looking forecast, Workmate helps planning teams highlight the relevant inputs to the forecast using what-if simulation. Users can then perform forecasts with natural-language prompts, such as "what if the weather is colder than expected next month?" or "what if I increase prices by 10%?". The user can use Workmate to then orchestrate the parameter changes to perform the simulation.
